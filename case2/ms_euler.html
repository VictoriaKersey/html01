<h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
<img src="ms_euler.png" alt=""/>

<p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, 
<strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, 
he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean 
Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, 
publishing over <em>800 different books and papers</em>. His 
influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>

<p>He is perhaps best known for his research into 
mathematical analysis. Euler's work, 
<i>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</i>, 
remained a standard textbook in the field for 
well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, 
he wrote 
<i>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</i>, 
giving a clear non-technical outline of the main 
physical theories of the time.</p>

<p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without 
copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such 
as <var>e and &pi;</var>, were introduced 
in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, 
leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>

<h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>

<p>Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:</p>

<sup><code>cos(x)+isin(x)=e^xi</code></sup>

<p>which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, 
complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this 
equation, it's easy to derive the identity:</p>

<sup><code>e^[pi]i+1=0</code></sup>

<p>which relates the fundamental constants: 
0, 1, <var>&pi;, e, and i</var> in a single beautiful and 
elegant statement. A poll of readers 
conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite>
magazine named Euler's Identity as the 
most beautiful theorem in the history of 
mathematics.</p>
